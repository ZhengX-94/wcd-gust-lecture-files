## Question

Suppose you are a data scientist at Netflix. One day, a product manager, Tom, comes to you and ask you a few product related questions. The product is a new recommender system. And there are three buckets, the first one is control group, which means recommendation is made randomly. The second group uses version 1 recommendation system. And the last group, third one, uses the version 2 recommendation system.

Tom is preparing a product launch meeting to roll out the new product. But  Tom is very junior, he need your advice on the following questions.

- What metrics should we look at? There are a few concerns, our KPIs move up or down? Does a user spend more time on Netflix? etc.

- If I want to test daily active users ratio and user's retention (how many minutes they spend on Netflix), what tests should I use. Rigorously, what is the Null Hypothesis.

- Another concern for Tom is, leadership team may be interested in lift, which is defined as compared with control groups, what is the increase for recommender system version 1 and version 2. Specifically, in this case, they want to know how many more hours does a user spend in different groups.
   - Compare version1 and control group
   - Compare version2 and control group
